# AMBA APB Protocol – Verilog Implementation & Verification

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a simplified **AMBA APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus)** system in Verilog, including:
- A custom **APB Master**
- Two **APB Slaves** with independent memory
- A **Top-level interconnect**
- A **feature-rich verification testbench**

The design strictly follows the **APB two-phase protocol** (SETUP → ACCESS) and supports **read/write transfers**, **slave selection**, **error signaling**, and **back-to-back transactions**.

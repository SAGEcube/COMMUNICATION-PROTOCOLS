# UART Transmitter and Receiver – SystemVerilog

## Overview
This project implements a **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter)** using **SystemVerilog**, including both **TX and RX modules** with a self-checking testbench.  
The design is verified through waveform analysis and console logs, confirming correct data transmission and reception.

## Functional Description

### Transmitter
- Transmission starts when `tx_enb` is asserted.
- A **start bit (0)** is sent first.
- Followed by **8 data bits (LSB first)**.
- Ends with a **stop bit (1)**.
- `busy` remains high during transmission.

### Receiver
- Detects the start bit on `rx`.
- Samples data bits using `rx_enb`.
- Assembles received byte.
- Asserts `rdy` once a full byte is received.
- Output data remains stable until `rdy_clr` is asserted.

---

## Testbench Description
- Applies reset and initializes signals.
- Sends multiple test bytes (e.g., `0x41`, `0x55`).
- Monitors TX/RX behavior.
- Automatically checks received data against transmitted data.
- Displays pass/fail messages in the simulation console.

---

## Simulation Results
- Correct start, data, and stop bit timing observed.
- `busy` signal active during TX operation.
- `rdy` asserted only after full byte reception.
- Received data matches transmitted data.
- All test cases passed successfully.

---

## Tools Used
- **Language:** SystemVerilog
- **Simulator:** Vivado / ModelSim / QuestaSim (any SV-compliant simulator)
- **Waveform Viewer:** Vivado Wave / GTKWave

## How to Run
1. Compile all RTL and testbench files.
2. Run simulation.
3. Observe console logs for PASS/FAIL messages.
4. View waveform to verify UART timing.

---

## Conclusion
The UART transmitter and receiver function correctly with accurate timing and reliable data transfer.  
This design is suitable for academic projects, interviews, and further extension (parity, FIFO, interrupts).
